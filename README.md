# NeverNet
An HTTP loader (for educational purpouses)

# PSA
This loader was created before I knew how to properly work with databases. As a result, the server's "databases" are a couple of JSON files in a folder.
Writing to them also doesn't work, so unless you know how to fix them, do not touch this. 
This project was made for educational purpouses. Nothing here is for malicious use.

# About Project
This is an HTTP botnet, designed to execute various commands on clients over HTTP. It has a very easy-to-use command system. All you need to do is create a new function and include it properly in the "commands" table.

# Maintenince
I will not maintain this project in the slightest unless it gains some kind of popularity. I just don't care enough or want to continue working on it.
